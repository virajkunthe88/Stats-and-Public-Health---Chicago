Class Project for Brainstation - The city of Chicago, Illinois has been keeping track of mosquito populations and WNV prevalence using a series of traps that they place around the city. They are then able to study the captured specimens and monitor the state of WNV spread in the city.

You are given mosquito tracking data from 2008 to 2019.

Answer a few business questions based on the usage data provided


Part 1 - Basic Data Wrangling

    What is the shape of the dataframe?

    Convert the 'Date' column to have a datetime format.

    Pick two numeric and two categorical columns: What data they are storing? How are they distributed?

    Are there any columns that contain duplicate information? If so, remove the redundant columns.

    Are there any null values in the dataframe? If so, deal with them appropriately.

Part 2 - Basic EDA

    Using an appropriate visual, or visuals, explore the relationship between mosquito number and date.

Part 3 - Advanced EDA

    Using an appropriate visual, explore the relationship between mosquito species and WNV prevalence.

    Using an appropriate visual, explore the relationship between the number of mosquitos caught and trap type.
    Note: This visual should be a different type of visualization than the previous one

    Using an appropriate visual, come up with an additional insight of your choice.
    Note: This visual should be a different type of visualization than the previous two
